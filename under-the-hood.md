# under the hood

take a look at this code:

```js
import auto from '@autolib/auto';

let _ = auto({

    name: 'karl',
    target: '#app1',

    el: (_) => document.querySelector(_.target),
    e0: (_) => document.createElement("h1"),
    t1: (_) => document.createTextNode(''),

    x0: (_) => _.e0.appendChild(_.t1),
    x1: (_) => _.el.append(_.e0),
    x2: (_) => _.t1.data = 'Hello ' + _.name

});

setTimeout(() => _.name = 'james', 1000);
setTimeout(() => _.target = '#app2', 2000);
setTimeout(() => _.target = '#app3', 3000);
```

this is what autodom will generate.
it's just like code generated by a
front-end framework (at least a compiled
one like svelte) but each line is put
into a reactive variable.

and it works, incredibly - each timeout
will 1. change the text field, 2. move
the whole thing.
